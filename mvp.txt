AML Actimize Tuning App MVP

App Description (MVP)
This app allows users to upload their own historical transaction data (CSV format). The backend processes this data and trains a Keras-based machine learning model to classify transactions as suspicious or non-suspicious. The app fine-tunes the model per user, optimizing for precision and recall based on user-specific patterns. It serves as a lightweight Actimize tuning tool for individuals or small teams looking to improve AML detection.

App Workflow (MVP)

1. User Upload
   - Users  upload a CSV file containing transaction data.
   - Required fields: transaction_id, amount, origin_country, destination_country, timestamp, account_id, label (1 = suspicious, 0 = not suspicious).

2. Data Validation & Preprocessing
   - Validate schema, nulls, duplicates.
   - Encode categorical variables, normalize numerical features.
   - Split into train/test (e.g. 80/20).

3. Model Training (Keras)
   - Use a simple neural network with adjustable parameters (user-defined or default).
   - Train on user-specific data to detect anomalies or suspicious activity.
   - Display key metrics: precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.

4. Model Evaluation & Results
   - Visualize flagged transactions.
   - Allow users to download flagged results or retrain model with adjusted parameters.

5. Optional
   - Let users provide feedback to improve labels (active learning).
   - Store anonymized model/data for tuning recommendations.

Required Components

- Frontend: React/Next.js UI for upload, results display, and metrics.
- Backend: Python (Flask or FastAPI) for processing, Keras model training.
- Storage: S3 or Firebase for user file uploads.
- Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing user profiles and model metadata.
